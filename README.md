Scalable Thread Management Library

Overview
The Scalable Thread Management Library is a Python library designed to simplify the management of threads in applications that require concurrent execution of tasks. 
This library provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and terminating threads, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability.


Features
Dynamic Thread Pool Management: Automatically adjusts the number of active threads based on workload.
Task Scheduling: Implements a thread-safe task queue with load balancing and priority-based scheduling.
Synchronization Mechanisms: Provides mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables to ensure safe resource sharing.
Monitoring & Performance Optimization: Tracks thread execution times and CPU utilization, with built-in logging and debugging tools.
Graceful Shutdown: Ensures all threads complete their tasks before shutting down the application.
